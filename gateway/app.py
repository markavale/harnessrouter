"""harness-gateway — thin, stateless control plane for Harness-as-a-Service.

Responsibilities (see docs/technical/HARNESS_AS_A_SERVICE_DESIGN.md):
  - Allocate an isolated sandbox per session from the ACA Dynamic Sessions pool and proxy
    turns into the in-sandbox runner (`{POOL}/turn?identifier=<session_id>`, Entra token
    aud `dynamicsessions.io` via the gateway's managed identity).
  - Credential BROKER over the existing Vault service: resolve a provider *connection*
    (org-own first, a shared `global` pool as fallback) and try an ordered fallback chain.
  - Concurrency gating (global + per-tenant); session state externalized to VectorGraph
    (`HarnessSession` vertex) so any replica serves any session.

State lives in VectorGraph + git + Blob, never in-process — this service is replaceable.

# Claude Code sending thinking params, because opus-4.7/4.8 rejected `thinking.enabled` with a
# 400 that leaked into the reply. That mechanism lived in the CLI's environment, so it only
# covered one harness and only the shape the CLI used at the time. The CLI has since moved to
# `output_config.effort`, which MAX_THINKING_TOKENS does not suppress, and haiku-4.5 rejects it
# with "This model does not support the effort parameter" — the same class of failure, on a
# different harness, through a different field.
#
# Every harness's inference traffic passes through this proxy, so enforcing it here covers
# Claude Code, Hermes, Codex and anything added later, across whichever thinking API a CLI
# happens to speak. The per-harness env hack is deleted rather than kept alongside: two
# mechanisms for one behaviour is how the first one went stale unnoticed.
# These travel together and must be removed together. `context_management`'s only strategy
# today (clear_thinking_20251015) is defined in terms of thinking, so removing `thinking` while
# leaving it produced a NEW 400 — "clear_thinking_20251015 strategy requires thinking to be
# enabled or adaptive" — turning one broken model into a broken harness. Against this provider

#   3. Failures returned a bare human string, so a client had to match on prose to decide whether to
#      retry. Added the structured error envelope. The old `detail` string is still emitted beside
#      it, because clients in the wild read it — it is documented as deprecated, not removed under

    # LLMTR is a Turkey-hosted gateway: models running on its own infrastructure in Turkey
    # beside the global frontier catalogue, behind one base_url and one key. Ids are
    # vendor-qualified like OpenRouter's, so the canonical is the id with the vendor prefix
    # removed — except where a canonical for that model already exists above (hunyuan-3 is
    # tencent/hy3, nemotron-3-ultra is the 550b-a55b id), because one model arriving in the
    # picker twice under two names is worse than a name that reads oddly.
    #
    # This table is deliberately the INTERSECTION with _MODEL_CATALOG rather than everything
    # LLMTR serves: connecting the provider adds no name to any picker, it only makes models
    # that are already there reachable through Turkey. Its published catalogue
    # (GET https://llmtr.com/v1/models, which needs no key) was read and measured on
    # 2026-08-19: of 245 published ids, 131 clear the agent-loop bar _MODEL_CATALOG states,
    # and the 107 of those that only LLMTR serves — including the three Turkey-resident
    # models, gemma-4, qwen3-6-35b and qwen3-5-4b — are proposed separately, once the
    # capability test can check this catalogue the way it checks OpenRouter's. The rules
    # they were measured by, so that follow-up can re-apply them rather than trust a number:
    #
    #   1. Text out and `tools` in supported_parameters — the same agent-loop bar
    #      _MODEL_CATALOG states. 81 fail it: embedders, image/video/speech models, and the
    #      small Turkish chat models (trendyol-asure-12b, magibu-11b-v8, medgemma-4b) that
    #      serve no tools.
    #   2. No dated snapshot of an id already listed (qwen-plus-2025-07-14 beside qwen-plus).
    #      The snapshot is the same model under a pinned name; two picker rows for it help
    #      nobody.
    #   3. The transport has to be the one the runner will actually use for that id. Both ways
    #      round, and 17 models fail it: gpt-5.4/5.2/5.1/5/o1/o3 and friends are published here
    #      for /v1/chat/completions only while hermes drives every gpt-5*/o[1-4] id over
    #      /v1/responses (_HERMES_RESPONSES_API_MODEL), and the grok ids are published for
    #      /v1/responses only while hermes drives them over chat. Offering either is a picker
    #      row that fails on send — the same broken promise _TOKENROUTER_NO_CHANNEL records.
    #   4. It has to answer. Every id was called live on 2026-08-19 — max_tokens=4 on
    #      /v1/chat/completions, max_output_tokens=16 on /v1/responses — and seven published as
    #      available did not, twice: llmtr/muse-glimmer-30b-tr returns no bytes at all (45 s,
    #      70 s and 120 s), publicai/apertus-8b-instruct 502s after about a minute,
    #      llmtr/ornith-1-35b and anthropic/claude-opus-4.1 502 immediately, aion-labs/aion-2.5
    #      and publicai/apertus-v1.5-8b 400, and openai/gpt-oss-120b 402 while the gpt-oss-20b
    #      beside it answers. A catalogue entry is an advertisement; an answer is the product.
    #
    # A ping is not a long agentic turn, so the harnesses on the test box ran real ones, each
    # completing without substitution: Claude Code over /v1/messages on claude-sonnet-4.6 and
    # claude-opus-4.8, hermes over /v1/chat/completions on claude-haiku-4.5, and codex over
    # /v1/responses on gpt-5.3-codex and gpt-5.5, both of which called the shell tool and came
    # back with its real output. A model here that turns out to fail a real turn comes off this
    # table the same way those seven did.
    #
    # One thing those runs turned up that is NOT this table's doing, recorded so the next person
    # does not have to rediscover it: driven by CODEX, gpt-5.6-sol, gpt-5.6-terra and
    # gpt-5.6-luna finish a turn but are never offered tools, so they cannot act — they answer
    # that they have no shell and stop. This is the codex CLI, not the provider. Pointed at a
    # local endpoint that records what it is sent, codex 0.148.0 emits the gpt-5.6-* request with
    # NO `tools` and NO `instructions` field at all, while the same binary against the same
    # endpoint sends 11 tools and a 21k-char instructions block for gpt-5.5. Nothing ever reaches
    # the provider for it to drop. The family first tries wss://api.openai.com/v1/responses and
    # its request carries x-codex-window-id, so it appears to expect the WebSocket session where
    # tools and instructions are established on the connection; falling back to plain HTTPS
    # against a configured provider, it sends neither. HERMES drives the same three ids over the
    # same /v1/responses transport against the same base_url with tools intact. So it applies to
    # every non-OpenAI provider, not this one: all three are already in _MODEL_CATALOG["codex"]
    # and reachable through openrouter, tokenrouter and vercel. Left alone here rather than
    # worked around in one vendor's table.

    #      capable: picking one produces a task that dies at the first tool call. Vision input is
    #      welcome, so a VLM qualifies; a model that only EMITS pixels does not. Enforced by
    #      tests/test_model_catalog_capabilities.py against the live capability data.
    #   2. A real turn on the harness that will run it, completed against the live provider,
    #      CHECKED FOR SUBSTITUTION. An unauthorized model is silently replaced by the harness
    #      default and the run records `requested_model` next to it — so a probe that only reads
    #      "completed" measures the default. Nine models once "passed" a file-writing test that
    #      was claude-sonnet-4.6 writing the file nine times, because the probe named a harness

    EVERY DNS answer is resolved and classified — loopback, link-local (which is where cloud
    metadata lives), RFC1918, CGNAT, IPv6 private, reserved — so a name whose second A record is
    internal is refused on the strength of that second record.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, because a comment claiming otherwise is worse than no comment: it does not
    survive a DNS rebind. This resolves the name; httpx then resolves it AGAIN when it opens the
    socket, so a TTL-0 name that answers 93.184.216.34 here can answer 10.0.0.5 a millisecond
    later and this check will have passed. Closing that means pinning the address we classified
    into the connection itself, which is a different piece of work and is not what this does. What
    it buys is the multi-A case and every literal internal address, and that is the whole of it.

    Shared by MCP URLs, database hosts and provider-supplied file URLs because it is one question,
    not three: each is a target somebody else names and this server then opens a socket to. A
    second copy of this rule would be a second thing to remember to fix.

    A LOOKUP THAT DID NOT ANSWER IS NOT AN ANSWER. This used to take an `allow_unresolvable` flag,
    on the reasoning that a name which does not resolve is not internal and cannot be reached
    anyway — and its `except Exception` swallowed a resolver timeout, an EAI_AGAIN under load and
    a resolver that was down along with the genuine NXDOMAIN. Our lookup failing says nothing
    about what the socket does a millisecond later: the caller resolves again, from its own
    resolver, in a cluster where `.svc` is a search domain. So there is no allow branch at all —
    an address this server could not classify is one it does not open a socket to.

    The two failures are still told apart, because the operator reading the log needs them apart:
    one of them is a bad URL and the other is a broken resolver.

    ASYNC BECAUSE getaddrinfo BLOCKS. It is a synchronous C call and it can sit for the resolver's
    whole timeout; run on the event loop it stops the entire process, not one request. Measured: a
    1.01 s lookup let ZERO other tasks run. Every provider file URL is classified on every poll, so
    one relay naming a slow-resolving host froze the gateway for everybody, ten seconds apart.

# ── The database, an ordinary MCP server ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A customer's own database, connected to one Harness: the agent explores it to decide what a
# dashboard should show, and the dashboard re-runs its queries when someone opens it.
#
# Its entry in `mcp_servers` is INDISTINGUISHABLE from a third-party one — {id, name, url,
# transport, auth, enabled} and not one field more. Nothing stored says "this one is ours",
# because nothing has to: a server is ours if its url is one of our own addresses
# (_hosted_mcp_path), and that answer is already knowable.
#
# THE ENTRY AND THE CONNECTION LIVE IN DIFFERENT PLACES, on purpose:
#   * The ENTRY is configuration. It rides the vertex read every turn already does, is listed,
#     renamed, switched off and removed exactly as any other server, and holds nothing about
#     which database it reads.
#   * THE CONNECTION — engine, host, database, the DSN, how many sample rows may be read — is one
#     encrypted record at the key the entry's `auth` references, owned BY THE SERVER. It goes
#     through BACKING.secrets with require_encryption=True, so host and database are encrypted at
#     rest alongside the credential. It is read here, inside the gateway, at the moment of use:
#     the runner never receives it, the browser never receives it, and neither does the agent —
#     an agent is given a tool that runs SELECTs, not a credential.
#
# The record names the server it is for and the harness it belongs to, and each endpoint refuses a
# record not addressed to it (see _hosted_resolve). `auth` is a client-writable field on an
# ordinary entry and harness ids are public, so that binding — not the shape of a key — is what
# stops one harness pointing at another's connection.
#
# Everything a statement passes through — the read-only gate, the row cap, the timeout — is in
# sql_plane.py, so the app's refresh and the agent's tool cannot diverge.

# ── Media, an ordinary MCP server ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Making a picture, a clip or a line of speech, and cutting the clips into one film. Same shape as
# the database next door and for the same reasons: its entry in `mcp_servers` is INDISTINGUISHABLE
# from a third-party one, a server is ours because its url is one of our own addresses, and the
# record the entry's `auth` names is owned BY THE SERVER.
#
# WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE DATABASE, and it is only this: nothing is collected from anyone. A
# database record holds a customer's connection string; a media record holds only the binding
# {server, harness}, because the provider credential is THIS DEPLOYMENT'S OWN INTEGRATION and must
# never become a per-harness secret. The record with no secret in it is the whole trick — the
# `harness-hosted-` prefix is still what makes the entry offerable, and `rec["harness"] == hid` is
# still what stops one harness addressing another's canvas.
#
# THE AGENT NEVER NAMES A MODEL. It asks for a capability; media_plane walks that capability's
# ordered candidate list and the tool reports which model actually ran. Four video models are
# listed and two are broken, which is exactly why.
#
# THE CANVAS IS OWNED BY THIS SERVER, not by the session workspace. Hosted, the gateway cannot
# durably write a live sandbox's workspace mid-turn — `_checkpoint` replaces the whole tarball from
# the sandbox at turn end, so anything written into it in between is gone (which is why
# PUT /v1/sessions/{sid}/files/{path} answers 409). So the scene lives in blob storage and is
# PROJECTED into the workspace after every mutation and after every checkpoint, write-only, so
# `scene.excalidraw` is still an ordinary artifact the console lists. Generated media are NOT
# projected: the workspace is a tarball rewritten whole at every checkpoint, and a ten-clip project
# would re-upload two hundred megabytes on every subsequent turn.

# candidate answers 200 with nothing in it, and later at POLL, when a render that billed comes
# back failed — and they are the same event to whoever is paying. What the submit walk spent is

# and the only place the poll walk can read it from.

# How many outbound submits ONE REQUEST may make AT ALL, whatever the provider answers to any of
# them — where a request is one tool call, one browser poll or one sweep pass. Separate from the
# budget above because it is a different fact: that one is about money and stops at the second
# render bought; this one is about sockets. A candidate that answers 4xx costs nothing and IS
# walked past — deliberately, because leaving a broken model in the chain
# is what let the owner's preferred one start working again on its own — but "costs nothing" is
# not "free": each submit carries the provider key out of this process, and a chain eleven long
# meant one tool call could make eleven of them. Four is the measured outage (one broken model at
# rank 1) with room, and a long way short of any chain in the catalog.
#
# WHERE IT IS CLAIMED, and why that is the whole of the fix: at `_media_call`, which is the only
# place in this process that opens a socket to a provider. It used to be claimed at the top of
# `_media_chain`'s loop, which counted the WALK — so `_media_job_resubmit`, which opens its own
# submit and which a synchronous render reaches inside the very same tool call, made a fifth one
# that no ceiling saw. Counting walks is what let four rounds of this bug each be "fixed" in the
# branch beside the one that overspent. A ceiling written in submits has to be counted in submits.
#
# IT BOUNDS THE POLL ENTRIES TOO, which took a sixth round to become true. It used to bound a
# SUBMIT WALK and nothing else: a poll pass built one budget per JOB out of `for_job`, which seeds
# `billed` off the job and left `submits` at zero, so `claim()` could not refuse anything and what
# actually stopped the walk was the `advances` check one branch over — a guard beside the socket,
# which is the construction this whole series exists to delete. Measured: one check_jobs over six
# failing jobs made six outbound submits, one _media_sweep() over five made five, and setting this
# number to 1 changed neither count.
#
# NOT AN OVERSPEND, and the fix is not sold as one. Per job the money rule held throughout
# (`advances` caps each job at `_MEDIA_MAX_ADVANCES + 1` renders) and the total across sweeps was
# unchanged: it was a BURST — six full-price renders started by what the agent issued as a read —
# and a ceiling that claims to bound a request while counting only a walk is how four rounds of
# this survived. So `submits` now belongs to the REQUEST and `billed` to the job; see the class.
#
# WHAT THIS COSTS, so the next reader does not have to find out the hard way: a free refusal is
# never quarantined, so every call starts the walk at rank 1 again. If the FIRST FOUR candidates
# all answer 4xx, no call ever reaches the fifth and the capability is refused until one of the
# four recovers. That is judged acceptable because the chains interleave providers on purpose —
# the first four of text_to_image span three of them — so four consecutive refusals means the
# relay itself is down, and the fifth candidate would not have answered either. If a chain ever
# stacks one provider's models at the top, this number and that fact have to be looked at
# together.
#
# AND ON THE POLL ENTRIES IT COSTS AN ADVANCE, not a delay — measured, because "the next pass will
# pick it up" is the first thing a reader assumes and it is not what happens. A pass that refuses
# a job's advance FAILS that job then and there, exactly as `_media_job_resubmit` has always done
# when the submit walk runs out: five failing jobs in one sweep means four get their second
# candidate and the fifth ends `failed` with the upstream error, for the agent to resubmit if it
# still wants the shot. Softening that by leaving the job running so a later pass retries is the
# tempting change and it is a re-buy: the render is banked and the model stood down BEFORE the
# submit is refused, so a second visit banks it twice (test_v42c pins this). The ceiling costs a
# retry, never a second charge.

    THE COUNT LIVES WHERE THE SOCKET IS, NOT WHERE THE EXITS ARE. This same overspend was closed

    poll walk was capped and the submit walk was not; then `except MediaEmpty` was capped and
    `except MediaError` was not; then the gate moved to the submit walk's loop and
    `_media_job_resubmit` went on opening its own socket beside it. Every one of those fixes

    claimed in `_media_call` — before the request goes out, in the one function that can send one.
    The ceiling therefore holds for an answer nobody has imagined, for an exception type invented
    next year, and for a caller that has never heard of this class.

    A CLAIM IS BILLABLE UNTIL THE ANSWER SAYS OTHERWISE. `claim` counts the submit against the
    money budget immediately and `free` gives it back only when the answer says nothing ran, which
    is the only evidence there is. That ordering is also what makes the ceiling hold when an agent
    fires four generate calls at once: the claim and the check happen with no await between them,
    so two concurrent walks cannot both see the last slot.

    TWO LIFETIMES, ONE OBJECT, BECAUSE THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT FACTS. `billed` is money and

    minutes between the tool call and the poll. `submits` is sockets and belongs to a REQUEST —
    nothing about one job says how many sockets the pass it is being polled in has opened. Keeping
    them in one object with one lifetime is what made the ceiling decorative on the poll path:

# went stale the moment the catalog here changed. Anything a user sees about a base is served from
# this table plus the live model catalog, so there is one answer and it is the running one.

# runtime and the console must not imply a guarantee the runtime cannot keep (see the protocol's
# harnesses.md §4.3):
#   hard        — the CLI enforces it (claude: --disallowedTools takes these exact names).
